1
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:11,210
Let's start with a discussion
of distributions.

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,280
And we'll start with the most
common using a coin.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,230
When a coin is flipped it has
a probability of landing heads up and

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,430
a probability of landing tails up.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,120
If we flip a coin many times we collect
a number of measurements of the heads and

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,900
tails that landed face up and

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,040
intuitively we know that the number
of times we get a heads up

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,600
will be equal about the number of times
we get a tails up for a fair coin.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,250
If you flipped a coin a hundred times and

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,690
you received heads each time you'd
probably doubt the fairness of that coin.

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,689
We can consider the result of each flip
of this coin as a random variable.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,020
When we can consider the set of all
possible random variables together

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,370
we call this a distribution.

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,290
In this case the distribution
is called binomial

15
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,230
since there's two possible
outputs a heads or a tails.

16
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,770
It's also an example of a discreet
distribution since there are only

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,020
categories being used a heads and
a tails and not real numbers.

18
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:09,100
NumPy actually has some
distributions built into it

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,950
allowing us to make random flips
of a coin with given parameters.

20
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,650
Let's give it a try.

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,830
Here we ask for a number from
the NumPy binomial distribution.

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,380
We have two parameters to pass in.

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,460
The first is the number of
times we want it to run.

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,200
The second is the chance we get a zero,
which we will use to represent heads here.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,330
Let's run one round of this simulation.

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,000
Great so

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,880
if you're following along in a Jupyter
notebook you either got a zero or a one.

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,420
And half of you got a value that
agreed with the one that I got.

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,760
What if we run the simulation
a thousand times and

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,690
divided the result by a thousand.

31
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,510
Well you see a number
pretty close to 0.5 which

32
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,740
means half of the time we had a heads and
half of the time we had a tails.

33
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,760
Of course an even weighted binomial
distribution is only one simple example.

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,120
We can also have unevenly
weighted binomial distributions.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,710
For instance what's the chance although
we're tornado today while I’m filming.

36
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,200
It's pretty low even though
we do get tornadoes here.

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,150
So maybe there a hundredth of a percentage chance.

38
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,740
We can put this into a binomial
distribution as a weighting in NumPy.

39
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,020
If we run this 100,000 times we see
there are pretty minimal tornado events.

40
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,550
So you might be wondering why I'm
talking about such a simple and

41
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,150
intuitive distribution.

42
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,620
I mean we all understand
flipping a coin for

43
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,120
when we had to make important
decisions as children.

44
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,870
But what I want to demonstrate is that the
computational tools are starting to allow

45
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,510
us to simulate the world which
helps us answer questions.

46
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,590
I could have shown you
the math behind this so

47
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,770
we could have worked
out the probabilities.

48
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,470
But a simulation is essentially
another form of inquiry.

49
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,330
Let's take one more example.

50
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,940
Let's say the chance of a tornado
here in Ann Arbor on any given day,

51
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,130
is 1% regardless of the time of year.

52
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,030
That's higher than realistic but
it makes for a quicker demo.

53
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,970
And lets say if there's a tornado I'm
going to get away from the windows and

54
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,620
hide, then come back and
do my recording the next day.

55
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,355
So what's the chance of this
happening two days in a row?

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,540
Well we can use the binomial
distribution in NumPy to simulate this.

57
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,990
Here we create an empty list and we create
a number of potential tornado events by

58
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,490
asking the NumPy binomial function
using our chance of tornado.

59
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,700
We'll do this a million times which is
just shy of 3,000 years worth of events.

60
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,840
This process is called
sampling the distribution.

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,360
Now we can write a little loop to
go through the list and look for

62
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,240
any two adjacent pairs of ones which means

63
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,820
that there were two days
that had back to back tornadoes.

64
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,880
We see that this ends up being roughly 102
day tornado events over the 3,000 years.

65
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,440
Which frankly is still too many for me.

66
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,690
My point here though is that modern
computational power allows us to very

67
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,370
quickly simulate the effects of
different parameters in a distribution.

68
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,530
Leading to a new way of
understanding the problem.

69
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,520
You don't have to work
out all the math you can

70
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,380
quite often simulate the problem
instead and observe the results.

71
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,430
In the next lecture we'll talk
a little bit more about distributions.
