00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:10,550
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,170
Today, we will be learning Numpy,
a package widely used in the data science

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,200
community which lets us work efficiently
with arrays and matrices in Python.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,710
First, let's import Numpy as np.

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,520
This lets us use the shortcut
np to refer to Numpy.

6
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,070
Now let's make our first array.

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,830
We can start by creating a list and
converting it to an array.

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,610
So here's our first Numpy array.

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,659
We can do it more succinctly
by passing the list directly.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,870
Now let's make multidimensional
arrays by passing in a list of lists.

11
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,130
We passed in two lists with three elements
each, and we get a two by three array.

12
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,020
We can check the dimensions
by using the shape attribute.

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,232
For the arange function, we pass in
a start, a stop, and a step size,

14
00:01:01,232 --> 00:01:05,016
and it returns evenly spaced
values within a given interval.

15
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:11,830
So suppose we wanted to convert this array
of numbers to a three by five array.

16
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,100
We can use reshape to do that.

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,170
The linspace function is similar
to arange, except we tell

18
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,920
it how many numbers we want returned, and
it will split up the interval accordingly.

19
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,480
We can use resize to change
the dimensions in place.

20
00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:34,300
Numpy also has several built-in functions
and shortcuts for creating arrays.

21
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:41,720
ones returns an array of ones,
zeros an array of zeros.

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,575
eye returns an array with ones on
the diagonal and zeros everywhere else,

23
00:01:46,575 --> 00:01:49,170
and diag constructs a diagonal array.

24
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,510
To create an array with repeated values,
we can pass in a repeated list, or

25
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,240
we can use Numpy's repeat function.

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Notice the difference
between the two outputs.

27
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,780
We can also combine arrays
to create new ones.

28
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,280
Let's create a two by three array of ones
and stack it vertically with itself,

29
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,480
multiplied by 2.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,396
And here's the same thing,
but stacking horizontally.

31
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:24,063
Now, let's look into some of the
operations you can do with Numpy arrays.

32
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:30,958
Performing elementwise addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and

33
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:35,369
division is straightforward, as is raising
all the numbers of an array to a power.

34
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,260
For those familiar with linear algebra,

35
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,760
the dot product can be done
using the dot function.

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,250
Let's create a new array using a previous
array y and its squared values.

37
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,550
The shape of this array is two by three.

38
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,510
We can also take the transpose
of an array using the t method,

39
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,060
which swaps the rows and columns.

40
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,909
The shape of the transposed
array is three by two.

41
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:10,975
Using dtype, we can see what
type of data the array has, and

42
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:14,782
with astype,
cast an array to a different type.

43
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:21,330
Numpy also has many useful math
functions that we can use.

44
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,820
Let's look at a few commonly used ones.

45
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,324
Here's our new array a.

46
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:36,423
And we can look the sum of the values
in the array, the maximum and

47
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:41,353
minimum, Or

48
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:44,255
the mean and standard deviation.

49
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:53,027
To find the index of a maximum or minimum
value, we can use argmax and argmin.

50
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:00,240
Next, let's learn about indexing and
slicing.

51
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,470
Let's create an array with
the squares of 0 through 12.

52
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,290
We can use bracket notation to get
the value at a particular index,

53
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,590
and the colon notation to get a range.

54
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,790
The notation is start and stepsize.

55
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,190
Specifying the starting or
ending index is not necessary.

56
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,836
And we can also use negatives to
count back from the end of the array.

57
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:33,398
For our first example, let's take a look
at the range starting from index one and

58
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,090
stopping before index five.

59
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,540
Next, let's get a slice of the last
four elements of the array.

60
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,400
And here, we're starting fifth from
the end to the beginning of the array and

61
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,480
counting backwards by two.

62
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,787
Let's see how this extends
to a two-dimensional array.

63
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,825
First, let's make a two dimensional array,
0 to 35.

64
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:02,720
We can get a specific value
by using the comma notation.

65
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,900
Here's the value at the second row and
second column.

66
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,396
Now let's use colon notation to
get a slice of the third row and

67
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:13,019
columns three to six.

68
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,336
We can also do something like
get the first two rows and

69
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:18,560
all of the columns except the last.

70
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,310
This is how we would select every
second element from the last row.

71
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,010
We can also use the bracket operator to
do conditional indexing and assignment.

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,106
For example, this will return
an array that is the elements of our

73
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:38,078
original array that are greater than 30.

74
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:41,824
And this assignment will take those
elements within our original array and

75
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,200
assign them to a new value.

76
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,950
Here, we're capping the maximum value
of the elements in our array to 30.

77
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,040
Next, let's look at copying data in Numpy.

78
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,540
First, let's create a new array r2,
which is a slice of the array r.

79
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,930
Now, let's set all the elements
of this array to zero.

80
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,820
When we look at the original array r,

81
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,770
we can see that the slice
in r has also been changed.

82
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,700
So this is something to keep in mind and

83
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,230
be careful about when
working with Numpy arrays.

84
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,660
If we wish to create a copy of the r array
that will not change the original array,

85
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,765
we can use r_copy.

86
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,144
We can see that if we change the values
of all the elements in r_copy to ten,

87
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:32,879
the original array r remains unchanged.

88
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,470
Lastly, let's learn how
to iterate over arrays.

89
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,698
First, let's create a four by three array
of random numbers, from zero through nine.

90
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:54,230
We can iterate by row by typing for
row in test, for example.

91
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,860
We can iterate by row index by
using the length function on test,

92
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,310
which returns the number of rows.

93
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,719
We can combine these two ways
of iterating by using enumerate,

94
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:09,360
which gives us the row and
the index of the row.

95
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,905
Let's make a new array, test2.

96
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,045
If we wish to iterate through both arrays,
we can use zip.

97
00:07:29,035 --> 00:07:30,900
Numpy has a lot to offer.

98
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,680
So be sure to look at the documentation
to find out about more great features.

99
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,980
Thanks for joining me.

100
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,031
Hope to see you next time.
