1
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:11,808
We talked about strings when we
talked about lists and slicing, and

2
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:15,116
you've seen ways to break up strings
through use of the split function,

3
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:17,430
and through direct indexing.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,390
Strings in Python can be a bit
frustrating too, and I want to share

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,220
some more details of how strings
are handled, so that you're aware of them.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,820
In Python 3 strings are Unicode based.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,060
In early computing characters of
strings were limited to one of 256

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,970
different values.

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,400
This was enough to get all of the upper or

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,890
lower case Latin characters, as well
as single digit numbers represented.

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,330
This language was called ASCII and
was fairly compact.

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,625
But the world doesn't just run on Latin
characters and there's a need to support

13
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:48,590
non-English languages as well as
characters which are not commonly used in

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,700
words, but are commonly used elsewhere
like mathematical operators.

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,610
The Unicode Transformation Format,
or UTF, is an attempt to solve this.

16
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,880
It can be used to represent over
a million different characters.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,170
This includes not only human
languages like you might expect, but

18
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,640
symbols like emojis too.

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,990
Python 3 uses Unicode by default so

20
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,850
there is no problem in dealing
with international character sets.

21
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,220
In addition to Unicode,
Python uses a special language for

22
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,536
formatting the output of strings.

23
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:22,051
One of the challenges with dynamic
typing is that it's bit unclear when

24
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:24,890
you have to do type conversion yourself.

25
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,605
We saw on the last lecture that if
we wanted to print out a name and

26
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:32,275
a number that we can't use concatenation
without calling the str function

27
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:34,945
to convert the number to a string first.

28
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:38,565
This creates a lot of nasty looking code
where every operator you're looking to

29
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,235
concatenate is wrapped
in this str function.

30
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:46,155
The Python string formatting mini
language allows you to write

31
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:50,490
a string statement indicating placeholders
for variables to be evaluated.

32
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,530
You then pass these variables in
either named or in order arguments,

33
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,110
and Python handles the string
manipulation for you.

34
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,940
Here's an example.

35
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,360
Imagine we have purchase order details and

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,120
a dictionary, which includes a number
of items, a price, and a person's name.

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,100
We can write a sales statement
string which includes these items

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,130
using curly brackets.

39
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,440
We can then call the format
method on that string and

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,439
pass in the values that we want
substituted as appropriate.

41
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,210
Now the string formatting language
allows you to do much more than this.

42
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,210
You can control a number of different
things like decimal places, for

43
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,970
floating point numbers, or whether you
want to prepend the positive numbers with

44
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,870
the plus sign, or set the alignment of
strings to left or right justified.

45
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,380
or even enable to use
of scientific notation.

46
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,740
I've linked the documentation
page in the course resources.

47
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,855
And being able to use
the string library and

48
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:51,210
formatting language will be an important
part of your first assignment.

49
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,090
This has been a short lecture, but

50
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,460
string manipulation is a big
part of data cleaning.

51
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,611
You're going to learn a lot more about
string manipulation in this course through

52
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:02,300
the assignments.

53
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,440
In the next video though,

54
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,810
our graduate student assistant is going
to show you how to bring some basic

55
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,430
data analysis together through the reading
and writing of delimited data files.
