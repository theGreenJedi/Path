1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,364
Interest in data science
is at an all time high, and

2
00:00:11,364 --> 00:00:15,240
really has exploded in popularity
in the last couple of years.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,890
A fun way to see this is to hit
up the Google Trends website.

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,470
Google Trends shows search
keyword information over time.

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,650
We could see that the term ‘data
science’ is massively popular,

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,370
really all across the globe.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,840
We can also see that related
queries include topics like python.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,190
And we can even see certain tool kits
that we’ll be teaching in this course.

9
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,070
For instance, here's the trend for

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,289
python pandas, which is the focus of
module two and three in this course.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,500
Before we jump in to a discussion of data
science, I'd like to take a moment and

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,680
have you reflect on what you
think data science is, and

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,390
why you came to this course to explore.

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,110
If someone you ran into asked you
what data science was all about,

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,248
what would you tell them?

16
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:04,226
The history of data science goes
back a little further than 2004,

17
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:06,664
which is where the Google
search term history begins.

18
00:01:06,664 --> 00:01:11,890
But this, at least, gives a sense for
how popular the area is now.

19
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,470
I think the popularity of interest in
the area comes from the network and

20
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,950
data driven society we
find ourselves living in.

21
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,190
When people think of
the term data scientist,

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,470
they tend to think of Google or
Amazon or Facebook,

23
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,790
places with big artificial intelligence
research teams, and certainly these

24
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,790
are some amazing companies who are doing
great things with data science.

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,480
But data scientist aren’t just limited
to careers with tech companies.

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,940
Almost every company is turning to data
science to better understand how to build

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,200
products, serve customers and
leverage new opportunities.

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,480
And companies aren't the only one. 
In this first course I will be giving

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,430
lectures here in the University of
Michigan digital innovation greenhouse.

30
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,040
Which was a lab within the office
of academic innovation.

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,030
The space is used by a team which includes
programmers, behavioral scientists and

32
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,410
data scientists who aim to build
technologies to support next generation

33
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,210
teaching and learning.

34
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,650
The background of individuals
here is very broad and

35
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,350
includes folks with computer science and

36
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,190
information degrees, psychology
degrees, and law and business degrees.

37
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,210
And here they apply data driven
methodologies to aid in their discovery,

38
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,920
from statistical analysis,
machine learning and

39
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,240
text mining, to information visualization.

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,320
And this need for data driven intelligence
and skills is growing in companies and

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,090
organizations throughout the world.

42
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,610
Let's start with a look at the roots
of the field of data science.

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,200
The techniques and methodologies of data
science stem from the fields of computer

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,290
science and statistics.

45
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,670
One of the most well cited diagrams
describing the field comes from Drew Conway

46
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,240
where he suggested data science is
the intersection of hacking skills,

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,010
math and stats knowledge,
and substantial expertise.

48
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,580
This diagram might be a bit
of an oversimplification, but

49
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,290
I think it's a great start.

50
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,580
Data science is definitely one of those
areas where you ask ten people and

51
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,679
get ten different answers.

52
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,210
One thing that I think is missing from
this diagram is the underlining need for

53
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,770
the scientific inquiry.

54
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,720
You don't necessarily get this for
having good hacking skills or math and

55
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,240
statistic knowledge.

56
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,270
A good data scientist bring skepticism,
experimentation,

57
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:23,050
simulation, and replication to bear
on understanding a given phenomena.

58
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,860
Whether it be trying to predict sales
at the coffee shop, cluster products in

59
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,720
an online store, determine who's
likely to win in election or

60
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,890
mine health data from
physiological sensors like Fitbits.

61
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,040
In this specialization we're going to
touch on all of these issue broadly but

62
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,390
really focus on skills.

63
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,260
In addition to the hacking
skills Conway mentions,

64
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,570
we're going to develop some communication
skills in the form of charting,

65
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,360
graphing, and related visualizations.

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,460
A good data scientist is one who can
communicate their findings clearly to

67
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,510
others and having some fundamental
tools in the toolkit as useful here.

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,670
We can find a more comprehensive and
academic discussion in the work of

69
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,930
David Donoho,
Professor of Statistics in Stanford.

70
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,380
Who's providing excellent commentary
of views of the field in

71
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,240
a paper entitled 50 years of data science.

72
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,260
We've provided a link to
that in a course resources.

73
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,250
There's lots to think
about with this paper,

74
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,040
but I want to draw your
attention to section 8,

75
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,310
where he describes the field broadly as
being made up of six activities.

76
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,790
The first of these is Data Exploration and

77
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,040
Preparation, this involves cleaning data
and manipulating it for further analysis.

78
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,970
The second is Data Representation and
Transformation.

79
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,100
This specialization is going to
look at several different forms of

80
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,370
representing data.

81
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,485
Tabular structures in the first course,
text data in the fourth course, and

82
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,760
graph-based data in the last course.

83
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,260
These are just some of the kinds of data
you have to deal with as a data scientist.

84
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,650
The third activity is Computing with
Data, and Donoho mentioned specifically

85
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,740
the languages of R and
Python as being fundamental here.

86
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,520
He goes further and
he talks about pipelining and

87
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,190
how data scientist need to be able
to work with different languages for

88
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,080
different parts on an analysis project and
I think this is very true.

89
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,830
Unlike enterprise software projects,
where you might use one language for

90
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,770
implementing all of
the functionality you need.

91
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,330
Modern data science projects can
span many different languages and

92
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,110
computing paradigms.

93
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,390
Knowing when to use the right tool for
the job is an important attribute.

94
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,760
The fourth activity is Data Modeling.
I think data modeling is a big space but

95
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,950
Donoho speaks specifically
about predictive modeling,

96
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,000
which we’ll talk about in the third
MOOC in this specialization and

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,730
generative modeling.

98
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,190
There's some fundamental differences here,
and I think the increased interest in

99
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,610
predictive modeling is helping to
fuel the current data science push.

100
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,890
In particular, the modern world,
with massive data streams and

101
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,230
significant computational power,

102
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,250
gives us opportunity to rapidly
experiment with making predictions.

103
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,340
Allowing us to innovate and
evaluate new data science techniques.

104
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,380
The fifth activity is
Data Visualization and Presentation.

105
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,580
Now the word visualization brings with it
a number of connotations, such as charting

106
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,030
and graphing, as well as 3D visualizations
and interactive environments.

107
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,930
In the second course we'll learn the
basics of information visualization, but

108
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,380
keep in mind that info viz
is a whole field of its own.

109
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,440
Finally, Donoho suggests there's sort
of a meta activity which he calls

110
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,720
the science about data science.

111
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,420
That is understanding what works and
what doesn't in data science, and

112
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,960
building ways to leverage
these discoveries.

113
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,680
We see examples of this as new tools and

114
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
paradigms of computing are invented
to change the way data science works.

115
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,700
I think Donoho provides a really nice
overview of the area of the data science.

116
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,330
In his paper he also alludes
to several investments,

117
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,960
research institutions are
putting into the field.

118
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,600
Including the University of California
in Berkeley, New York University,

119
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,060
MIT and the University in Michigan, here,

120
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,900
which just kicked off a $100
million data science initiative.

121
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,340
Data science is becoming a fundamental
way of understanding the world around us.

122
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,770
While many institutions, including my own,

123
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,020
are starting to offer data science
masters degrees and certificate.

124
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,550
I think it's important to think of data
science as a sort of epistemology, or

125
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,830
a way of knowing.

126
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,850
Data science thinking can be useful in
a variety of disciplines and careers.

127
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,990
It is a way of approaching problems and
critical thinking skills.

128
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,200
But this is a skills based course, so in
the next lecture we're going to jump right

129
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,650
in and start talking about
the Python programming language.
