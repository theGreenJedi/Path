00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,088
In this video, I'm going to talk about 
the use of binary codes for image 

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:08,554
retrieval. 
For retrieving documents, people like 

3
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:14,380
Google have such good methods already, 
the techniques like semantic hashing may 

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,510
not be of much value. 
But retrieving images is much more 

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,631
difficult and the methods that convert an 
image into a fairly large binary code of 

6
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:30,674
say, 256 bits, seem to work quite well. 
However, we don't want to do a very long 

7
00:00:30,674 --> 00:00:36,333
sequencial search through vectors of 256 
bits so semantic hashing can be used to 

8
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:41,782
first create a short list and then we can 
get better quality matches by using 

9
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:47,371
longer binary codes in a serial search. 
Now, we get to look at using binary codes 

10
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:51,563
for image retrieval. 
Image retrieval of present is typically 

11
00:00:51,563 --> 00:00:55,357
done by using the captions. 
But why not use the images too? 

12
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:59,295
They obviously contain a lot more 
information than the captions. 

13
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:02,495
The basic problem is that pixels are not 
like words. 

14
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:06,618
Individual pixels don't tell us much 
about the content of an image. 

15
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:11,171
Obviously if you could recognize the 
objects in the images, then we'd have 

16
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:15,416
things that were much more like words. 
But recognizing objects is hard. 

17
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:18,038
At least it was when we first did this 
work. 

18
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:22,984
Now deep neural nets have got much better 
at it, and so that may well be the way to 

19
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:25,487
go. 
So if we're not going to recognize the 

20
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:29,837
objects, maybe what we should do is 
extract a vector that has information 

21
00:01:29,837 --> 00:01:34,067
about the content of the image. 
And the obvious thing to extract is the 

22
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:38,517
real valued vector. 
But the problem is that matching real 

23
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:43,264
value vectors in the real data base is 
slow and it also requires a lot of 

24
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:48,075
storage for the real value vectors. 
If we can extract a fairly short binary 

25
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:53,206
vector that contains a lot of information 
about the image that's much easier to 

26
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:57,825
store and much faster to match, even 
faster is to use a two stage method. 

27
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:02,892
So first, we extract a short binary code 
of about 30 bids and that short binary 

28
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:07,639
code is used with semantic hashing to 
very rapidly get us a short list of 

29
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:11,550
promising images. 
So we simply take the short binary code, 

30
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,075
and flip a few bits in it to get 
candidate images. 

31
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:20,505
The candidate images can then be matched 
using 256 bit binary codes that are 

32
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:25,300
stored with each known image. 
To search for much better matches than 

33
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,757
can be found with a 28 bit binary code. 
Even a 256 bit binary code only requires 

34
00:02:31,757 --> 00:02:37,561
four words of memory per image. 
And even though we're then going to do a 

35
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:42,109
serial on these binary codes. 
The search can be done very fast, because 

36
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:47,326
it only requires a few operations to 
compare two, 256 binary codes to find out 

37
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:52,331
how many bits they have in common. 
The question is, how good is a binary 

38
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:58,015
code of that size at retrieving images?. 
Are they going to find images that we 

39
00:02:58,015 --> 00:03:02,665
think of as being similar? 
So here's a net that trained by Alex 

40
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:06,283
Krizhevsky. 
It's working on small color images so 

41
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:11,967
they're only 32 pixels by 32 pixels and 
he takes his input the red, green, and 

42
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:15,510
blue channels from those images so 3,000 
inputs. 

43
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:21,342
He then expands that to a larger number 
of hidden units because we're going to go 

44
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:24,839
from real value inputs to logistic hidden 
units, 

45
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:30,310
which probably have less capacity. 
We then progressively decrease the number 

46
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,910
units in each layer until we get down to 
256 bits. 

47
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,787
This encoder has about 67 million 
parameters. 

48
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:42,193
It's quite big. 
It takes a few days to train it on, in 

49
00:03:42,193 --> 00:03:45,308
video GPU. 
And I'll exchange it on two million 

50
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,491
images. 
There's absolutely no theory to justify 

51
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:52,487
the architecture we used. 
We know we want a fairly deep net. 

52
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:55,941
It makes sense to make it get an arrow as 
we go up. 

53
00:03:55,941 --> 00:04:01,291
But this particular architecture, where 
you have the number of units each layer, 

54
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,948
is just a guess. 
The interesting thing is, a guess like 

55
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:09,010
this already works quite well. 
And presumably, there are some other 

56
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,537
architectures that will work better. 
The first question to ask is how well 

57
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:17,810
does an ordering coder like this do at 
reconstructing the images? 

58
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,674
So, here is a face image and it's 
reconstruction and you can see that from 

59
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:26,552
the reconstruction you can tell the kind 
of an image it is. 

60
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:31,285
Here's another example, where it's a 
scene probably at a party, you can't 

61
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:36,741
really tell what kind of scene it is from 
the image but you might guess that there 

62
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:39,962
are a number of people involved or you 
might not. 

63
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:44,002
Here's an outdoor scene. 
And you can see that the reconstruction 

64
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:47,020
captures a lot of information about the 
accuracy. 

65
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,061
It captures the water in the sky and the 
hyphens of thin strip land. 

66
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:57,176
So lets look at the quality of 
retrievable we can do within ordering 

67
00:04:57,176 --> 00:05:00,661
codes that gives those kinds of 
reconstruction. 

68
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:06,073
We'll start with a picture of Michael 
Jackson in the red square and Alex 

69
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:11,707
retrieved the most similar images and 
above each image you can see how many 

70
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:14,970
bits had differed from Michael Jackson 
body. 

71
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,483
And you'll notice they're all a fairly 
similar number of bits. 

72
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:25,235
In 256 bits, differing by only 61 bits is 
extraordinarily unlikely to happen by 

73
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:30,549
chance if they were random images. 
It has to be a pretty similar image to 

74
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:35,136
differ by so few bits. 
One nice thing about what's retrieved is, 

75
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:40,669
with one exception, they're all faces. 
If we look at the retrieval you get by 

76
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,280
using euclidean distance on the raw 
pixels, 

77
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,730
then some of them are faces, but most of 
them aren't. 

78
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,641
So obviously the ordering coder has 
understood something about faces that 

79
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:56,360
isn't in the information about Euclidean 
distance. 

80
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,020
It's clearly giving much better 
retrieval. 

81
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,519
Let's take another example, here we took 
the image of a party scene and we treat 

82
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,231
of the images. 
And you can see that about half of them 

83
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:14,250
have images you would think of as fairly 
similar that other party scenes. 

84
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,200
The tip of the other party scenes with 
something bright in the middle, like the 

85
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,087
oiginal party scene, and you'll also 
notice that most of the bad matches also 

86
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:28,912
have something bright in the middle. 
So even though we're getting down to 256 

87
00:06:28,912 --> 00:06:33,924
bit binary codes through a lot of hidden 
layers, it's still sensitive to quite a 

88
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:37,997
lot about the image structure and where 
the brighter patches are. 

89
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,757
If you look at what Euclidean distance 
does, it's much worse. 

90
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:45,830
Euclidean distance gets one other scene 
with a, a group of people. 

91
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,720
And then everything else is fairly 
dissimilar. 

92
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,780
You'll notice with Euclidean distance, it 
often gets very smooth images. 

93
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,661
That's because if you can't match the 
high frequency variation in the image, 

94
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:04,607
it's better to match its average then to 
get other stuff with high frequency 

95
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:08,462
variations out of phase. 
So when you got a complicated image, 

96
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:12,830
including in distance will typically find 
smooth images to match it. 

97
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,530
And that's because it's minimizing a 
squared error in pixel space. 

98
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,806
So obviously we'd like the image 
retrievable to be more sensitive to the 

99
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:25,668
content of the image that is stored kinds 
of objects in the relationships in image 

100
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:28,245
and less sensitive to the pixel 
intensities. 

101
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:32,932
We can do that by first training a big 
net to recognize lots of different kinds 

102
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:37,150
of object in real images and we show you 
how to do that in lecture five. 

103
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:42,149
Then we take the activity vector, in the 
last hidden layer of the big net, and use 

104
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:47,087
that as a representation of the image. 
This should be much better than the pixel 

105
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:51,840
intensities at capturing information 
about the kinds of objects in the image. 

106
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,631
So to see if this approach is likely to 
work, we use the net described in lecture 

107
00:07:56,631 --> 00:08:01,305
five, the one the image that competition. 
So far, we've only tried it on Euclidan 

108
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:05,210
distance, between the activity of vectors 
in the last hidden layer. 

109
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,327
But obviously if it works for that, 
we could then that those activity vectors 

110
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:15,179
and build an ordering code around those 
to get them down to binary codes. 

111
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:19,100
So let's first see if it works with the 
Euclidean distance. 

112
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,660
It turns out it works really well. 
We don't know yet whether it will work 

113
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,892
with binary codes. 
So, in the column on the left, you see 

114
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:33,206
the query images. 
And then to the right of them, you see 

115
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:38,349
all the things that were retrieved. 
If you look at the elephant query image, 

116
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:43,767
you'll see that what gets retrieved is 
other elephants but elephants with very 

117
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:47,745
different poses. 
So those images wouldn't have a very good 

118
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:52,203
overlap in pixel space, although the 
overlap wouldn't be that bad. 

119
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:57,621
If you look at the Halloween pumpkins, 
you'll see that all the retrieved things 

120
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:02,826
are other Halloween pumpkins. 
And some of them, would have a pretty bad 

121
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:07,689
overlapping pixel space. 
Similar with the aircraft carriers, we 

122
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:12,867
retrieve other images of aircraft carrier 
that are very different. 

123
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:19,300
So we anticipate that if we could reduce 
the activity vector to short binary code. 

124
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,026
We would have a fast and effective way of 
retrieving similar images just by the 

125
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:29,178
content of the image. 
We'll see in lecture sixteen that we 

126
00:09:29,178 --> 00:09:34,976
could actually combine the content of the 
image with the caption of the image, to 

127
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:37,410
get an even better representation.
