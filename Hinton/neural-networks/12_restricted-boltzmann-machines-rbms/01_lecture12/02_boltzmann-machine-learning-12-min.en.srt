1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,048
In the previous video,
I showed how a Boltzmann machine can be

2
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:08,910
used a probabilistic model of a set of
binary data vectors.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,213
In this video we're finally going to get
around to the Boltzmann machine learning

4
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:17,646
algorithm.
This is a very simple learning model which

5
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:22,285
has an elegant theoretical justification,
but it turned out in practice, it was

6
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:25,319
extremely slow and noisy, and just wasn't
practical.

7
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:29,482
And for many years, people thought that
Boltzmann machines would never be

8
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:32,931
practical devices.
Then we found several different ways of

9
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:35,489
greatly speeding up the learning
algorithm.

10
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,890
And now the algorithm is much more
practical, and has, in fact, been used as

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,767
part of the winning entry for a million
dollar machine learning competition, which

12
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:49,168
I'll talk about in a later video.
The Bolton machine learning algorithm is

13
00:00:49,168 --> 00:00:54,023
an unsupervised learning algorithm.
Unlike the typical user back propagation,

14
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:58,892
where we have a input vector and we
provide it with a desired output. In

15
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:03,086
Boltzmann machine learning we just give it
the input vector.

16
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:08,767
There are q labels. What the algorithm is
trying to do is build a model of a set of

17
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:13,840
input vectors, though it might be better
to think of them as output vectors.

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:21,127
What we want to do is maximize the product
of the probabilities, that the Boltzmann

19
00:01:21,127 --> 00:01:23,762
machine assigns to a set of binary
vectors,

20
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:29,520
The ones in the training set.
This is equivalent to maximizing the sum

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,320
of the log probabilities that the
Boltzmann machine assigns to the training

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,102
vectors.
It's also equivalent to maximizing the

23
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:42,697
probability that we'd obtain exactly the
end training cases, if we ran the

24
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:49,301
Boltzmann machine in the following way.
First, we let it settle to its stationary

25
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:53,620
distribution, and different times, with no
external input.

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,621
Then we sample the visible vector once.
Then we let it settle again, and sample

27
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,740
the visible vector again.
And so on.

28
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,221
Now the main reasons why the learning
could be difficult.

29
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:14,300
This is probably the most important
reason.

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,773
If you consider a chain of units,
A chain of hidden units here, with visible

31
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:26,865
units attached to the two ends,
And if we use a training set that consist

32
00:02:26,865 --> 00:02:30,446
of one, zero and zero, one.
In other words, we want the two visible

33
00:02:30,446 --> 00:02:34,839
units to be in opposite states.
Then the way to achieve that is by making

34
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:38,148
sure that the product of all those weights
is negative.

35
00:02:38,148 --> 00:02:43,082
So, for example, if all of the weights are
positive, turning on W1 will tend to turn

36
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:47,054
on the first hidden unit.
And that will tend to turn on the second

37
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:50,784
hidden unit, and so on.
And the fourth hidden unit will tend to

38
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:55,658
turn on the other visible unit.
If one of those weights is negative, then

39
00:02:55,658 --> 00:03:00,060
we'll get an anti-correlation between the
two visible units.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,457
What this means is, that if we're thinking
about learning weight W1, we need to know

41
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,635
other weights.
So there's W1.

42
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:13,758
To know how to change that weight, we need
to know W3.

43
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:19,905
We need to have information about W3,
because if W3 is negative what we want to

44
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:25,740
do with W1 is the opposite of what we want
to do with W1 if W3 is positive.

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,149
So given that one weight needs to know
about other weights in order to be able to

46
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:37,794
change even in the right direction, it's
very surprising that there's a very simple

47
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:42,440
learning algorithm, and that the learning
algorithm only requires local information.

48
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,642
So it turns out that everything that one
weight needs to know about all the other

49
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:54,819
weights and about the data is contained in
the difference of two correlations.

50
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:59,864
Another way of saying that is that if you
take the log probability that the

51
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,050
Boltzmann machine assigns to a visible
vector V.

52
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:10,199
And ask about the derivative of that log
probability with respect to a weight, WIJ.

53
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:17,436
It's the difference of the expected value
of the products of the states of I and J.

54
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:24,236
When the networks settle to thermal
equilibrium with v clamped on the visible

55
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:28,614
units.
That is how often are INJ on together when

56
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:35,606
V is clamped in visible units and the
network is at thermal equilibrium, minus

57
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:39,820
the same quantity.
But when V is not clamped on visible

58
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,301
units, so because the derivative of the
log probability of a visible vector is

59
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:50,853
this simple difference of correlations we
can make the change in the weight be

60
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:56,475
proportional to the expected product of
the activities average over all visible

61
00:04:56,475 --> 00:05:00,200
vectors in the training set, that's what
we call data.

62
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,616
Minus the product of the same two
activities when your not clamping anything

63
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:10,840
and the network has reached thermal
equilibrium with no external interference.

64
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,097
So this is a very interesting learning
rule.

65
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:19,001
The first term in the learning rule says
raise the weights in proportion to the

66
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:23,231
product of the activities the units have
when you're presenting data.

67
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:27,400
That's the simplest form of what's known
as a Hebbian learning rule.

68
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,842
Donald Hebb, a long time ago, in the 1940s
or 1950s, suggested that synapses in the

69
00:05:32,842 --> 00:05:37,437
brain might use a rule like that.
But if you just use that rule, the synapse

70
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:42,277
strengths will keep getting stronger.
The weights will all become very positive,

71
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:46,688
and the whole system will blow up.
You have to somehow keep things under

72
00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:51,712
control, and this learning algorithm is
keeping things under control by using that

73
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:55,082
second term.
It's reducing the weights in proportion to

74
00:05:55,082 --> 00:05:59,983
how often those two units are on together,
when you're sampling from the model's

75
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:04,719
distribution.
You can also think of this as the first

76
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,854
term is like the storage term for a
Hopfield Net.

77
00:06:07,854 --> 00:06:12,461
And the second term is like the term for
getting rid of spurious minima.

78
00:06:12,461 --> 00:06:16,044
And in fact this is the correct way to
think about that.

79
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:19,500
This rule tells you exactly how much
unlearning to do.

80
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,260
One obvious question is why is the
derivative so simple.

81
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,471
Well, the probability of a global
configuration at thermal equilibrium, that

82
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:36,543
is once you've let it settle down, is an
exponential function of its energy.

83
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,060
The probability is related to E to the
minus energy.

84
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,494
So when we settle to equilibrium we
achieve a linear relationship between the

85
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:52,775
log probability and the energy function.
Now, the energy function is linear in the

86
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:56,093
weights.
So, we have a linear relationship between

87
00:06:56,093 --> 00:07:01,306
the weights and the log probability.
And since we're trying to manipulate log

88
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:05,775
probabilities by manipulating weights,
that's a good thing to have.

89
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:12,097
It's a log linear model.
In fact, the relationship's very simple.

90
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:17,643
It's that the derivative of the energy
with respect to a particular weight WIJ is

91
00:07:17,643 --> 00:07:22,040
just the product of the two activities
that, that weight connects.

92
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,998
So what's happening here?
Is the process of settling to thermal

93
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:31,597
equilibrium is propagating information
about weights?

94
00:07:31,597 --> 00:07:34,925
We don't need an explicit back propagation
stage.

95
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:38,593
We do need two stages.
We need to settle with the data.

96
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:43,595
And we need to settle with no data.
But notice that the networks behaving in

97
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:46,477
pretty much the same way in those two
phases.

98
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:51,408
The unit deep within the network is doing
the same thing, just with different

99
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:55,250
boundary conditions.
With back prop the forward pass and the

100
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:02,666
backward pass are really rather different.
Another question you could ask is what's

101
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,794
that negative phase for.
I've already said it's like the unlearning

102
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:10,121
we do in a Hopfield net to get rid of
spurious minima.

103
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:15,792
But let's look at it in more detail.
The equation for the probability of a

104
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:21,638
visible vector, is that it's a sum overall
hidden vectors of E to the minus the

105
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:25,338
energy of that visible and hidden vector
together.

106
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:30,000
Normalized by the same quantity, summed
overall visible vectors.

107
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,758
So if you look at the top term, what the
first term in the learning rule is doing

108
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:42,608
is decreasing the energy of terms in that
sum that are already large and it finds

109
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:48,315
those terms by settling to thermal
equilibrium with the vector V clamped so

110
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:53,880
that it can find an H that goes nicely
with V, that is gives a nice low energy

111
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,663
with V.
Having sampled those vectors H, it then

112
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:01,460
changes the weights to make that energy
even lower.

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,413
The second phase in the learning, the
negative phase, is doing the same thing,

114
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:13,185
but for the partition function.
That is, the normalizing term on the

115
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,802
bottom line.
It's finding global configurations,

116
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:21,198
combinations of visible and hidden states
that give low energy,

117
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:25,593
And therefore, are large contributors to
the partition function.

118
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:30,338
And having find those global
configurations, it tries to raise their

119
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:36,591
energy so that the can contribute less.
So the first term is making the top line

120
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:39,940
big, and the second term is making the
bottom line small.

121
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,292
Now in order to run this learning rule,
you need to collect those statistics.

122
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:51,506
You need to collect what we call the
positive statistics, those are the ones

123
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:55,997
when you have data clamped on the visible
units, and also the negative statistics,

124
00:09:55,997 --> 00:10:00,488
those are the ones when you don't have
data clamped and that you're going to use

125
00:10:00,488 --> 00:10:05,194
for unlearning.
An inefficient way to track these

126
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:09,740
statistics was suggested by me and Terry
Sejnowski in 1983.

127
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,987
And the idea is, in the positive phase you
clamp a data vector on the visible units,

128
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:19,440
you set the hidden units to random binary
states,

129
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,632
And then you keep updating the hidden
units in the network, one unit at a time,

130
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:28,700
until the network reaches thermal
equilibrium at a temperature of one.

131
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,227
We actually did that by starting at a high
temperature and reducing it, but that's

132
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:39,592
not the main point here.
And then once you reach thermal

133
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:43,633
equilibrium, you sample how often two
units are on together.

134
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:48,840
So you're measuring the correlation of INJ
with that visible vector clamped.

135
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,175
You then repeat that, over all the visible
vectors, so that, that correlation you're

136
00:10:54,175 --> 00:11:00,876
sampling is averaged over all the data.
Then in the negative phase, you don't

137
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:04,314
clamp anything.
The network is free from external

138
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:08,103
interference.
So, you set all of the units, both visible

139
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:13,624
and hidden, to random binary states.
And then you update the units, one at a

140
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:18,017
time, until the network reaches thermal
equilibrium, at a temperature of one.

141
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:24,142
Just like you did in the positive phase.
And again, you sample the correlation of

142
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:29,762
every pair of units INJ,
And you repeat that many times.

143
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:35,071
Now it's very difficult to know how many
times you need to repeat it, but certainly

144
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:39,996
in the negative phase you expect the
energy landscape to have many different

145
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:43,770
minima, but are fairly separated and have
about the same energy.

146
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:48,153
The reason you expect that is we're going
to be using Boltzmann machines to do

147
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:52,199
things like model a set of images.
And you expect there to be reasonable

148
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:54,841
images, all of which have about the same
energy.

149
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:58,437
And then very unreasonable images, which
have much higher energy.

150
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:02,821
And so you expect a small fraction of the
space to be these low energy states.

151
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:06,980
And a very large fraction of the space to
be these bad high energy states.

152
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,787
If you have multiple modes, it's very
unclear how many times you need to repeat

153
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:15,398
this process to be able to sample those
modes.
