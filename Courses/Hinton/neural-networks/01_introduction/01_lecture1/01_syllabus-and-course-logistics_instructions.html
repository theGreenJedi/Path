  Welcome to the course!
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are 16 modules ("lectures") and each module will be divided into about five short videos. In each module there will be a quiz that counts towards your final grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The modules are broken down into the following:
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 1: Introduction
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 2: The Perceptron learning procedure
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 3: The backpropagation learning procedure
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 4: Learning feature vectors for words
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 5: Object recognition with neural nets
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 6: Optimization: How to make the learning go faster
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 7: Recurrent neural networks
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 8: More recurrent neural networks
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 9: Ways to make neural networks generalize better
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 10: Combining multiple neural networks to improve generalization
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 11: Hopfield nets and Boltzmann machines
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 12: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs)
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 13: Stacking RBMs to make Deep Belief Nets
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 14: Deep neural nets with generative pre-training
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 15: Modeling hierarchical structure with neural nets
 </p>
 <p>
  Lecture 16: Recent applications of deep neural nets (optional videos)
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The two module quizzes
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Each module, there will be two quizzes (one per lecture) that do count towards your final grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The programming assignments
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You will need to answer questions about the results produced by the programs and your answers will count towards your final grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first programming assignment will be very simple. It is mainly intended to get you to download Octave and get used to using it (see the Octave installation link). We regret that we do not have the resources to support other languages, but if you have Matlab it should be simple to adapt the Octave code we provide. You will not need to submit any code.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The final test
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The final test will be 25% of the final grade, the programming assignments will be 30% and the weekly quizzes 45%.
