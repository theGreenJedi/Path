00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
In this video, I'm going to describe how a
recurrent neural network solves a toy

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,729
problem.
It's a problem that's chosen to

3
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:14,621
demonstrate what it is you can do with
recurrent neural networks that you cannot

4
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:18,259
do conveniently with feet forward neural
networks.

5
00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:21,460
The problem is adding up two binary
numbers.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,205
Off to the recurrent neural network, has
learned to solve the problem.

7
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:31,500
It's interesting to look at its hidden
states, and see how they relate to the

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,588
hidden states in a finite state automaton
that's solving the same problem.

9
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:40,440
So consider the problem of adding up two
binary numbers.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,898
We could train a feed-forward neural
network to do that.

11
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:50,411
And the diagram on the right shows a
network that gets some inputs and produces

12
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:53,650
some outputs.
But there's problems with using a

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,754
feed-forward neural network.
We have to decide in advance what the

14
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:04,785
maximum number of digits is both for both
of the input numbers and for the output

15
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:08,785
number.
And more importantly, the processing that

16
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:14,094
we apply to the different bits of the
input numbers, doesn't generalize.

17
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:20,226
That is, when we learn how to add up the
last two digits and deal with the carries,

18
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:25,834
that knowledges in some weights.
And as we go to a different part of a long

19
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:30,694
binary number, the knowledge will have to
be in different weights.

20
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:36,938
So we won't get automatic generalization.
As a result, although you can train a

21
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:41,578
neuron feedfoward neural network, and it
will eventually learn to do binary

22
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,340
addition on fixed-length numbers, it's not
an elegant way to solve the problem.

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,863
This is a picture of the algorithm for
binary addition.

24
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:58,576
The states shown here are like the states
in a hidden Markov model, except they're

25
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:03,080
not really hidden.
The system is in one state at a time.

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,954
When it enters a state it performs an
action.

27
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:13,927
So it either prints a one or prints a zero
and when it's in a state it gets some

28
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:18,232
input, which is the two numbers in the
next column.

29
00:02:18,232 --> 00:02:22,365
And that input causes it to go into a new
state.

30
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:27,918
So if you look on the top right,
It's in the carry station and it's just

31
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:32,069
printed a one.
If it sees a one, one, it goes back in to

32
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:38,844
the same stage and print another one.
If however it sees a one, zero or zero,

33
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:43,419
one, It goes into the carry state but
prints a zero.

34
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:49,882
If it sees a zero, zero, it goes into the
no carry state, and prints a one.

35
00:02:49,882 --> 00:02:55,562
And so on.
So a recurring neuro net for binary

36
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:59,820
edition needs to have two input units and
one output unit.

37
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,480
It's given two input digits at each time
stamp.

38
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,656
And it also has to produce an output at
each time step.

39
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:15,311
And the output is the output for the
column that it took in two time steps ago.

40
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:20,966
The reason we need a delay of two time
steps, is that it takes one time step to

41
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:26,477
update the hidden units based on the
inputs, and another time step to produce

42
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:32,436
the output from the hidden state.
So the net looks like this.

43
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:36,389
I only gave it three hidden units.
That's sufficient to do the job.

44
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,761
It would learn faster with more hidden
units, but it can do it with three.

45
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:45,192
The three hidden units are fully
interconnected and they have connections

46
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:48,965
in both directions that don't necessarily
have the same weight.

47
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:52,020
In fact in general they don't have the
same weight.

48
00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:00,137
The connections between hidden units allow
the pattern of one time step to insensate

49
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:06,553
the pattern of the next time step.
The input units have feed forward

50
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:12,230
connections to the hidden units and that's
how it sees the two digits in a column.

51
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:18,046
And similarly, the hidden units have feed
forward connections to the output unit and

52
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:25,577
that's how it produces its output.
It's interesting to look at what the

53
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:31,854
recurring neural network learns.
It learns four distinct patterns of

54
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:36,781
activity in its three hidden units.
And these patterns correspond to the nodes

55
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:39,940
in the finite state automaton for binary
addition.

56
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,791
We must confuse the units in a neural
network, with the nodes in a final state

57
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,329
automaton.
The nodes in the finite state automaton

58
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:54,400
correspond to the activity vectors of the
recurrent neural network.

59
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,125
The automaton is restricted to being
exactly one state at each time.

60
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:06,767
And similarly, the hidden units are
restricted to have exactly one activity

61
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:10,680
vector at each time in the recurrent
neural network.

62
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,089
So a recurrent neural network can emulate
a finite state automaton but it's

63
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:21,766
exponentially more powerful in its
representation.

64
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:26,620
With any hidden neurons, it has 2n to the
N possible binary activity vectors.

65
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,455
Of course it only has n squared weights so
it can't necessarily make full use of all

66
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:36,565
that representational power.
But if the bottleneck is in the

67
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:42,114
representation a recurrent neural network
can do much better than a finite state

68
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:46,715
automaton.
This is important when the input stream

69
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:53,199
has two separate things going on at once.
A finite state automaton needs to square

70
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,628
its number of states in order to deal with
the fact that there's two things going on

71
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:03,160
at once.
A recurrent neural network only needs to

72
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,286
double its number of hidden units.
By doubling the number of units, it does

73
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:12,720
of course square the number of binary
vector states that it has.
