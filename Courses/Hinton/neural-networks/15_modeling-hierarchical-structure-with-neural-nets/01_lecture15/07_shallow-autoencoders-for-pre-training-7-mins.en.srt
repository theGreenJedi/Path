00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,930
In this video, I'm going to talk about 
alternative pre-training methods for 

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,054
learning deep neural nets. 
I introduced pre-training using 

3
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:16,400
restrictive Boltzmann machines trained 
with contrastive divergence. 

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,777
But after that, people discovered there 
are many other ways to pre-train layers 

5
00:00:21,777 --> 00:00:25,384
of features. 
And indeed, if you initialize the weights 

6
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:30,829
correctly, you may not need pre-training 
at all provided you have enough labeled 

7
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,477
data. 
We've seen some of the neat things that 

8
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:36,995
can be done with the codes produced by 
deep auto-encoders. 

9
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:41,263
I now want to consider shallow 
auto-encoders that just have one hidden 

10
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:44,165
layer. 
Restricted Boltzmann machines can be used 

11
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:48,667
with shallow auto-encoders, particularly 
if they're trained with contrastive 

12
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:53,596
divergence because they're trying to make 
the reconstructions look like the data. 

13
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:57,916
When do you use an autoencoder? 
A restricted Boltzmann machine has very 

14
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:02,723
strong regularization because the hidden 
units are only allowed to have binary 

15
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:05,826
activities, 
and this restricts their capacity a lot. 

16
00:01:05,826 --> 00:01:10,754
If we train restricted Boltzmann machines 
with maximum likelihood, they're not at 

17
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:14,846
all like auto-encoders. 
One way to see that is if you had a pixel 

18
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:20,294
that was pure noise, an auto-encoder 
would try to reconstruct whatever noise 

19
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:23,926
value it had. 
A restricted Boltzmann machine trained 

20
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:29,723
with maximum likelihood would completely 
ignore that pixel and model it just using 

21
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:33,565
the bias for that input. 
So, since we can view a restricted 

22
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:38,595
Boltzmann machine as a kind of a strongly 
regularized auto-encoder, maybe we can 

23
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:42,480
replace the RBMs that we use for 
pre-training with a stack of 

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,409
autoencoders. 
It turns out that if you do that, 

25
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,994
pre-training is not as effective. 
At least, that's true if you use shallow 

26
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:54,642
auto-encoders that are regularized just 
by penalizing the squared weights. 

27
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:59,418
So, stacking these autoencoders doesn't 
work as well as stacking restricted 

28
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:02,921
Boltzmann machines. 
However, there's a different kind of 

29
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:06,734
auto-encoder that does work as well, 
and that's the denoising auto-encoder. 

30
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:12,040
And, it's been studied extensively by the 
group in Montreal. 

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,095
Denoising auto-encoders work by adding 
noise to each input vector by setting 

32
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:22,484
many of the components to zero, but it's 
different components for different input 

33
00:02:22,484 --> 00:02:25,677
vectors. 
This resembles dropout, but it's for the 

34
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:30,400
inputs rather than the hidden units. 
The denoising auto-encoder is still 

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,589
required to reconstruct, the inputs that 
have been set to zero. And so, it can't 

36
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,373
just copy its input. 
The danger with the shallow auto-encoder 

37
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:44,034
is that if you give it enough hidden 
units, it might just copy each pixel to 

38
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:48,328
one hidden unit, and then reconstruct 
that pixel from that hidden unit. 

39
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:53,173
A denoising auto-encoder clearly can't do 
that so it has to use hidden units to 

40
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:58,080
catch a correlation between inputs so 
that it can use the values of some inputs 

41
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,760
to help it reconstruct the inputs that 
have been zeroed out. 

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,625
If we use a stack of denoising 
auto-encoders, pre-training is very 

43
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,598
effective. 
There's some cases in which RBMs still 

44
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:12,879
work better, but in most cases denoising 
auto-encoders are more effective. 

45
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,041
It's also much simpler to evaluate the 
pre-training using a denoising 

46
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:21,680
autoencoder because we can easily compute 
the value of the objective function. 

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,728
When we pre-train a restricted Boltzmann 
machine with contrast divergence, we 

48
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:29,510
can't compute the value of the real 
objective function we're trying to 

49
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,747
minimize. 
So, we often just use the squared 

50
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:35,262
reconstruction error, which is not 
actually what's being minimized. 

51
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:39,523
In a denoising auto-encoder, we can print 
out the value of the thing we're trying 

52
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:43,252
to minimize, and that's very helpful. 
One disadvantage of the denoising 

53
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:47,034
autoencoder is that it lacks the nice 
variational boundary we get with 

54
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:50,762
restricted Boltzmann machines. 
But that's only of theoretical interest 

55
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:55,024
because it only applies if the restricted 
Boltzmann machine is trained with maximum 

56
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:57,817
likelihood. 
Yet another kind of auto-encoder is the 

57
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:01,950
contractive auto-encoder, that was also 
developed by the group in Montreal. 

58
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:07,607
The way this works is that we try to make 
the hidden activities be as insensitive 

59
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:12,023
as possible to the inputs. 
Of course, the hidden units can't just 

60
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:17,405
ignore the inputs altogether because they 
have to be able to reconstruct them. 

61
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:22,856
The way we achieve this insensitivity is 
by penalizing the squared gradient of 

62
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:27,962
each hidden unit with respect to each 
input. So, we try to make each hidden 

63
00:04:27,962 --> 00:04:32,240
unit so that it won't change much if we 
change an input value. 

64
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,149
Contractive auto-encoders also work very 
well for pre-training. 

65
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:41,005
Their codes tend to have the property 
that only a small subset of the hidden 

66
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:45,734
units are in their sensitive range. 
For different parts of the space, it's a 

67
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:49,770
different subset and so this active set 
acts like a sparse code. 

68
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,105
The other hidden units are unsaturated 
and are insensitive. 

69
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:57,265
RBMs actually have a very similar 
behavior. 

70
00:04:57,265 --> 00:05:02,997
After they've been trained, many of the 
hidden units will be saturated, and the 

71
00:05:02,997 --> 00:05:08,655
working set of the unsaturated ones will 
be different for different training 

72
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:11,668
cases. 
I want to finish by summarizing my 

73
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:16,932
current view of pre-training. 
There are now many different ways to do 

74
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:20,597
layer by layer pre-training that 
discovers good features. 

75
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:24,198
When our data set does not have a huge 
number of labels, 

76
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:29,342
this way of discovering features before 
you ever use the labels is very helpful 

77
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:32,300
for the subsequent discriminative fine 
tuning. 

78
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,352
It discovers the features without using 
the information in the labels, and then 

79
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:42,725
the information in the labels is used for 
fine tuning the decision banquets between 

80
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:45,794
classes. 
It's especially useful if we have a lot 

81
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:50,208
of unlabeled data so that the 
pre-training can be a very good job of 

82
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,597
discovering interesting features, using a 
lot of data. 

83
00:05:53,597 --> 00:05:58,258
For very large labeled data sets however, 
initializing the weights that are going 

84
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:03,055
to be used for supervised learning by 
using unsupervised pre-training is not 

85
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:07,552
necessary, even if the nets are deep. 
Pre-training was the first good way to 

86
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:11,870
initialize the weights for deep nets, but 
now we have lots of other ways. 

87
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,890
However, even if we have a lot of labels, 
if we make the nets much larger again, 

88
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,016
we'll need pretraining again. 
So, an argument I often have with people 

89
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:26,561
from Google is they say, we've got lots 
and lots of labelled data so we don't 

90
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:30,568
need regularization methods. 
Our nets won't over fit anyway because 

91
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:34,096
we've got so much data. 
The counter-argument is, that's only 

92
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:37,087
because you're using nets that are much 
too small. 

93
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:41,512
You should use much, much bigger nets on 
much, much more powerful computers. 

94
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:46,177
And then, you'll start over fitting again 
and you'll need these regularization 

95
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:50,860
methods, like dropout and pre-training. 
If you ask which regime the brain is in, 

96
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,492
the brain is clearly in the regime where 
it got huge numbers of parameters 

97
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:59,753
compared with the amount of data its got. 
And so to the brain, at least, 

98
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,347
regularization methods are very 
important.
