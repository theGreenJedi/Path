1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,108
. 
In this video I'm going to show how we 

2
00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:08,969
can first learn a deep belief net by 
stacking up restricted Boltzmann 

3
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:12,164
machines. 
And then we can treat that as a deep 

4
00:00:12,164 --> 00:00:16,140
neural net that we fine tune 
discriminatory. 

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,331
So instead of fine tuning it to be better 
at generation, as we did in the previous 

6
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:26,880
video, we're going to fine tune it to be 
better at discriminating between classes. 

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,320
This works very well and led to a big 
renewal of interest in neural networks. 

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,489
In speech recognition, it's had a major 
influence and many leading groups are now 

9
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:45,463
switching to using deep neural nets in 
order to reduce the error rate, in speech 

10
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:48,895
recognition. 
I now want to talk about fine tuning 

11
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:52,390
these deep networks to be better at 
discrimination. 

12
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,598
So we first learn one layer of features 
at a time, by stacking up restricted 

13
00:00:57,598 --> 00:01:01,817
Boltzmann machines. 
Then we treat this as pre-training that 

14
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:07,506
finds a good initial set of weights in 
the DPO network and we fine tune those 

15
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:10,569
weights using some local search 
procedure. 

16
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:16,696
In the previous video I showed you how to 
use contrustive weight sleep to fine tune 

17
00:01:16,696 --> 00:01:21,620
a deep network so that it was better 
generating its inputs. 

18
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:27,120
In this video we're going to use back 
propagation to fine tune a model to be 

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,691
better at discrimination. 
If we do this it overcomes many of the 

20
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:38,636
standard limitations of back propagation. 
It makes it much easier to learn deep 

21
00:01:38,636 --> 00:01:41,990
nets. 
And it makes those nets generalise 

22
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,911
better. 
We need to understand why back 

23
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:48,420
propagation when we pre-train the 
weights. 

24
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,395
And there's really two effects. 
There's an effect on optimization and 

25
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:59,020
there's an effect on generalization. 
So the pre-training scales really well if 

26
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,274
we have big networks, especially if each 
layer has locality. 

27
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:08,899
So if we're doing vision, for example, 
and we had local receptor fields in each 

28
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:14,235
layer, then there's not much interaction 
between widely separate locations. 

29
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:19,139
And so it's very easy to learn a big 
layer more or less in parallel. 

30
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,310
When we do pre-training. 
We don't start back propagation until 

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,456
we've already learned sensible feature 
detectors. 

32
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:30,952
And these feature detectors should be 
very helpful for discrimination. 

33
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:35,768
So the initial gradients are much more 
sensible than if we use random ones. 

34
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:39,364
And back propagation doesn't need to do a 
global search. 

35
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:43,603
It just needs to do a local search from a 
sensible starting point. 

36
00:02:43,603 --> 00:02:48,419
In addition to being easier to optimize, 
pre-trained nets exhibit much less 

37
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:51,901
overfitting. 
That's because most of the information in 

38
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:56,550
the final weights comes from modeling the 
distribution of input vectors. 

39
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,005
And these input vectors, if you're 
dealing with something like images, 

40
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:04,427
generally contain a lot more information 
than labels. 

41
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:09,269
A label typically only contains a few 
bits of information to constrain the 

42
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,401
mapping from input to output. 
Whereas an image contains a lot of 

43
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:18,115
information which will constrain any 
generative model of a set of images. 

44
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:22,803
The information in the labels is only 
used for the final fine tuning And 

45
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:27,183
because by that stage we've already 
decided on the feature detectors, we're 

46
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:32,030
not squandering that precious information 
designing feature detectors from scratch. 

47
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,890
The fine tuning only makes slight changes 
to the feature detectors we learned in 

48
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,248
the generative pre-training phase. 
And those are the changes required to get 

49
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:46,216
the category boundaries in the right 
place. 

50
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:50,979
The important thing is the back 
propagation is not being required to 

51
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:55,120
discover new features. 
And so it doesn't need nearly as much 

52
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,517
label data. 
In fact, this type of learning works well 

53
00:03:58,517 --> 00:04:03,341
when most of the data is unlabeled, 
because the generative pre-training can 

54
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:07,650
make use of the light data. 
The unlabeled data is still very useful 

55
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,024
for discovering good features. 
There is an obvious objection to this 

56
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:16,270
type of learning, which is that when we 
do generative pre-training. 

57
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:20,511
We'll be learning lots of features that 
are useless for the particular 

58
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,020
discriminative task we want the net to 
do. 

59
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,382
Consider, for example, that you might 
want the net to discriminate between 

60
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:31,922
shapes or you might want the net to 
discriminate between different poses of 

61
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:35,692
one shape. 
They need very different features, and if 

62
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:41,129
you don't know the task in advance. 
You'll inevitably learn features that are 

63
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:44,314
never used. 
When computers were much smaller, that 

64
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:48,603
was the serious objection. 
But now that computers are large enough, 

65
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:51,982
we can afford to learn features that are 
never used. 

66
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:57,181
And, we can afford it because among all 
the features we learn, there will be some 

67
00:04:57,181 --> 00:05:00,301
that are much more useful than their raw 
inputs. 

68
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:05,565
And that more than makes up for the fact 
that we have learned some features that 

69
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:09,400
aren't helpful for the particular task 
we're interested in. 

70
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,125
So let's apply this to modeling the 
m-list digits. 

71
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:18,600
We'll now learn three hidden layers of 
features entirely unsupervised. 

72
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,020
Once we've done that learning, when we 
generate from the model, 

73
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,089
it will generate things that look like 
real digits. 

74
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:29,399
And it'll generate them from all the 
different classes. 

75
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,093
And it'll typically take a while before 
it switches from one class to another. 

76
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:38,907
And it will typically take a while before 
it switches from one class to another 

77
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:43,541
because it'll tend to stay in the same 
ravine for a while before it jumps to 

78
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,670
another ravine. 
But the question is, are the features 

79
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,281
that we've learned that way useful for 
doing discrimination? 

80
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:54,072
So all we need to do is add a final 
10-way soft max at the top. 

81
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:58,827
And fine tune it with back propagation. 
And see if we do better than purely 

82
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:03,173
discriminative training. 
So here's the results on the permutation 

83
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:07,386
invariant M-ness task. 
And what I mean is permutation invariant 

84
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:12,535
is, if we were to apply a fixed random 
permutation to all the pixels, the same 

85
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:17,417
permutation to every test and training 
case, the results of our algorithm 

86
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:21,028
wouldn't change. 
That's clearly not true for something 

87
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:25,627
like a convolutional net. 
A convolutional net's been told something 

88
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:29,320
about the task. 
By applying this fixed permutation, we 

89
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,965
destroy all simple ways of telling the 
net something about the spatial nature of 

90
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:37,683
the task. 
So if you apply standard back 

91
00:06:37,683 --> 00:06:42,370
propagation. 
It's hard to do better than 1.6% errors. 

92
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,308
John Platt and myself have both tried 
quite hard applying standard back 

93
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:50,669
propagation with various different 
architectures. 

94
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:55,060
And we're both quite good at doing it. 
You can actually beat 1.6%. 

95
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,289
By using constraints on the incoming 
weight vectors of the hidden units. 

96
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:06,173
If you use an appropriate restriction on 
the length of an incoming weight vector, 

97
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:12,309
you can do a bit better than 1.6%. 
Support vector machines can get 1.4 

98
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:15,719
percent. 
And this was one of the pieces of 

99
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:21,333
evidence that led to support vector 
machines, supplanting back propagation. 

100
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:26,037
If you pretrain a network using a stack 
of Boltzmann Machines. 

101
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:32,182
And then you fine tune it to be better at 
generating the joint density of digits 

102
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:35,748
and image labels. 
Then you can get down to 1.25%. 

103
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:40,831
If you train a stack of Boltzmann 
machines, and simply put a 10-way 

104
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:45,080
[INAUDIBLE] on top, and fine tune it. 
You can get to 1.15%. 

105
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,519
And with more fiddling around, you can 
get that down to about one%. 

106
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,480
So you can do a lot better than standard 
back propagation. 

107
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,026
And also better than support vector 
machines by using generative pre-training 

108
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:04,286
followed by discriminative fine tuning. 
Mackerie Yerenzato working in Yan 

109
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:09,772
LeCanne's group also showed, using a 
slightly different pre-training method, 

110
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:15,112
that pre-training helps for models that 
have more data and better prions. 

111
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:19,428
So they used an additional 60,000 
distorted digital images. 

112
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:24,987
So they had a lot more training data. 
They also used convolution multilinear 

113
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:28,279
network. 
And Yan's group is the best group, at 

114
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,188
tuning those. 
With back propagation, they managed to 

115
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:36,471
get down to.49%. 
When they did the unsupervised layer by 

116
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:41,765
layer pre-training, followed by back 
propagation they got down to.39%. 

117
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:47,449
Which at the time was a record. 
So you may remember this picture from the 

118
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:52,152
first lecture. 
This was one of the examples I gave of 

119
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:56,013
the successive neural nets. 
It's the same picture. 

120
00:08:56,013 --> 00:09:01,764
Back then, I said we could get down to 
20.7% by pre-training and then fine 

121
00:09:01,764 --> 00:09:07,988
tuning with back propagation, and that 
the previous, and that the previous speak 

122
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:14,291
independent record on Timint was 24.4%. 
Which actually required averaging several 

123
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:18,072
models. 
Lee Ding at Microsoft Research picked up 

124
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:23,540
at this result immediately and 
collaborated on improving it. 

125
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,222
And this has led to a big change in 
speech recognition. 

126
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:32,243
If you look at this news story, it will 
refer you to a blog where the chief 

127
00:09:32,243 --> 00:09:37,532
research officer for Microsoft is talking 
about the big improvements in speech 

128
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:40,545
recognition caused by using deep neural 
nets.
