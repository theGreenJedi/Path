1
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:12,110
The series is one of the core
data structures in pandas.

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,710
You think of it a cross between a list and
a dictionary.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,165
The items are all stored in an order and

4
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:18,670
there's labels with which
you can retrieve them.

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,450
An easy way to visualize
this is two columns of data.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,485
The first is the special index,
a lot like the dictionary keys.

7
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:26,670
While the second is your actual data.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,058
It's important to note that the data
column has a label of its own and

9
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:32,391
can be retrieved using
the .name attribute.

10
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:34,425
This is different than
with dictionaries and

11
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:37,162
is useful when it comes to
merging multiple columns of data.

12
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,389
And we'll talk about that
later on in the course.

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,860
As you might expect, you can create
a series by passing in a list of values.

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,540
When you do this, Pandas automatically
assigns an index starting with zero and

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,950
sets the name of the series to None.

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,740
Let's see an example of this.

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,250
First, I'll start off by importing
the pandas library as pd,

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,990
then let's take a look
at the series object.

19
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,311
Here you could see the documentation
indicates that you can pass in some data,

20
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,432
an index and a name.

21
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:07,617
The data can be anything,
that's array-like, like a list.

22
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:10,037
So let's give that a try.

23
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:13,759
We'll just make a list of the three
of my favorite animals, a tiger,

24
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:14,795
a bear and a moose.

25
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:18,274
We'll see here that the pandas has
automatically identified the type of

26
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:21,923
the data being held in the list, in this
case we passed in a list of strings and

27
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:23,368
panda set the type to object.

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,461
We don't have to use strings.

29
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:31,619
If we passed in a list of whole numbers,
for instance,

30
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,311
we could see that panda
sets the type to n 64.

31
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:39,680
Underneath panda stores series values in
a typed array using the Numpy library.

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,130
This offers significant speed-up when
processing data versus traditional

33
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:43,740
python lists.

34
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,280
There's some other typing
details that exist for

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,320
performance that are important to know.

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,839
The most important is how Numpy and
thus pandas handle missing data.

37
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:56,840
In Python, we have the none type
to indicate a lack of data.

38
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,684
But what do we do if we want to
have a typed list like we do in

39
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:00,726
the series object?

40
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:09,700
Underneath, pandas does
some type conversion.

41
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,596
If we create a list of strings and
we have one element, a None type,

42
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:18,139
pandas inserts it as a None and uses
the type object for the underlying array.

43
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:22,406
If we create a list of numbers, integers
or floats, and put in the None type,

44
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:27,073
pandas automatically converts this to a
special floating point value designated as

45
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:29,130
NAN, which stands for not a number.

46
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,580
For those who might not have done
scientific computing in Python before,

47
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,020
this is a pretty important point.

48
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,784
NAN is not none and
when we try the equality test, it's false.

49
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:49,690
It turns out that you actually can't
do an equality test of NAN to itself.

50
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,300
When you do, the answer is always false.

51
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,340
You need to use special
functions to test for

52
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,160
the presence of not a number,
such as the Numpy library is NAN.

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,290
We'll come back to this
later in the assignment, but

54
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,840
keep in mind when you see NAN,
it's meaning is similar to none, but

55
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,690
it's a numeric value and it's treated
differently for efficiency reasons.

56
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,590
Let's talk more about how
pandas' series can be created.

57
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,390
While my list of animals might be
a common way to create some play data,

58
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,210
often you have label data
that you want to manipulate.

59
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,630
A series can be created
from dictionary data.

60
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,850
If you do this, the index is automatically
assigned to the keys of the dictionary

61
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,290
that you provided and
not just incrementing integers.

62
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,640
Here's an example using some data from
Wikipedia on official national sports.

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,610
When we create the series, we see that,

64
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:39,160
since it was string data, panda set
the data type of the series to object.

65
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,770
We set the list of the countries
as the value of the series and

66
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,860
that the index values can be set
to the keys from our dictionary.

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
Once the series has been created,

68
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,490
we can get the index object
using the index attribute.

69
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,900
You could also separate your index
creation from the data by passing in

70
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,520
the index as a list
explicitly to the series.

71
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,290
So what happens if your
list of values in the index

72
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,748
object are not aligned with the keys in
your dictionary for creating the series?

73
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:10,390
Well, pandas overrides the automatic
creation to favor only and

74
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,275
all of the indices values
that you provided.

75
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:17,210
So it will ignore it from your dictionary,
all keys, which are not in your index, and

76
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,610
pandas will add non type or NAN values for
any index value you provide,

77
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,290
which is not in your dictionary key list.

78
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,500
In this example,
we pass in a dictionary of four items but

79
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,520
only two are preserved in the series
object because of the index list.

80
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,395
We see that hockey has been added but
since it's also in the index list,

81
00:04:35,395 --> 00:04:37,345
it has no value associated with it.

82
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:41,870
So that's how we create a series.

83
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,280
In the next class, we'll dig deeper and
look at how we get data out of the series.
