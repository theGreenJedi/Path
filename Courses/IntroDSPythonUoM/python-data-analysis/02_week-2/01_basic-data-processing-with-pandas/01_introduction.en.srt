00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,420
This week we're going to deepen our
investigation to how Python can be used to

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,300
manipulate, clean, and query data by
looking at the Pandas data tool kit.

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,340
Pandas was created by
Wes McKinney in 2008, and

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,680
is an open source project under
a very permissive license.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,240
As an open source project
it's got a strong community,

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,980
with 100 software developers all
committing code to help make it better.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,590
There's a couple of places you should
consider going to for help with Pandas.

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,960
Obviously, the course discussion
forums make for a great resource.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,515
But I don't think they're
the best resource for

10
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:39,410
Pandas problems in particular.

11
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,430
I think the best resource is a question
answering site called Stack Overflow.

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,220
Stack Overflow is used broadly within
the software development community to post

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,490
questions about programming, programming
languages, and programming toolkits.

14
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,590
What's special about Stack Overflow
is that it's heavily curated by

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,220
the community.

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,550
And the Pandas community, in particular,
uses it as their number one resource for

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,130
helping new members.

18
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,830
It's quite possible if you post
a question to Stack Overflow, and

19
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,100
tag it as being Pandas and

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,760
Python related, that a Pandas developer
will actually respond to your question.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,450
In addition to posting questions,
Stack Overflow is a great place to go

22
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,540
to see what issues people are having and
how they can be solved.

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,899
You can learn a lot from browsing
Stacks at Stack Overflow.

24
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:24,357
A second resource you might
want to consider are books.

25
00:01:24,357 --> 00:01:28,641
In 2012 Wes McKinney wrote the definitive
Pandas reference book called Python for

26
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:31,590
Data Analysis and published by O'Reilly.

27
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,310
While it's starting to get a bit dated,

28
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,880
he recently announced that a new
edition of the book is coming, and

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,110
I still consider this a go to book for
understanding how Pandas works.

30
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,230
I also appreciate the more brief
book Leaning the Pandas Library by

31
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,580
Matt Harrison.

32
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,840
It's not a comprehensive book
on data analysis and statistics.

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,100
But if you just want to learn
the basics of Pandas and

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,770
want to do so quickly,
I think it's a well laid out volume.

35
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,490
The field of data science
is rapidly changing.

36
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,620
There's new toolkits and
method being created everyday.

37
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,630
It can be tough to stay on top of it all.

38
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,780
And Marco Rodriguez and

39
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,100
Tim Golden maintained a wonderful blog
aggregator site called Planet Python.

40
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,360
You can visit the webpage at
planetpython.org, subscribe with an RSS

41
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,240
reader, or get the latest articles
from the @PlanetPython Twitter feed.

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,080
There's lots of regular Python
data science contributors, and

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,190
I highly recommend it if
you follow RSS feeds.

44
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,550
Here's my last plug on how
to deepen your learning.

45
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,020
Kyle Polich runs an excellent
podcast called Data Skeptic.

46
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,216
Well, it isn't Python based per se,
it's well produced and

47
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:34,397
it has a wonderful mixture of interviews
with experts in the field as well as short

48
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:36,010
educational lessons.

49
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,280
Much of the word he describes is
specific to machine learning methods.

50
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,620
But if that's something you are planning
to explore through this specialization

51
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,040
this course is in, I would really
encourage you to subscribe to his podcast.

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,380
Well that's it for a little bit
of an introduction to this week.

53
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,190
Next we're going to dive right into Pandas
and talk about the series data structure.
