00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:13,620
A pivot table is a way of summarizing data
in a data frame for a particular purpose.

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,610
It makes heavy use of
the aggregation function.

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,830
A pivot table is itself a data frame,
where the rows represent one variable that

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,770
you're interested in, the columns another,
and the cell's some aggregate value.

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,190
A pivot table also tends to
includes marginal values as well,

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,590
which are the sums for
each column and row.

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,030
This allows you to be able to see the
relationship between two variables at just

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,640
a glance.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,980
Let's take a look at an example.

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,713
Here we'll load a new data set, cars.csv.

11
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:46,275
This data set comes from the Open Data
Initiative of the Canadian government.

12
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:49,774
And has information about the efficiency
of different electric cars which

13
00:00:49,774 --> 00:00:52,070
are available for purchase.

14
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,326
When we look at the head
of the data frame,

15
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:58,837
we'll see that there are model years,
vendors, sizes of cars, and statistics,

16
00:00:58,837 --> 00:01:01,364
like how big the battery
is in kilowatt hours.

17
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:06,009
A pivot table allows us to pivot out one
of these columns into a new column headers

18
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:09,980
and compare it against another
column as row indices.

19
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,770
For instance,

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,360
let's say we wanted to compare the makes
of electric vehicles versus the years and

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,770
that we wanted to do this comparison
in terms of battery capacity.

22
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,500
To do this, we tell pandas we
want the values to be kilowatts,

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,240
the index to be the year and
the columns to be the make.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,369
Then we specify that
the aggregation function,

25
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,667
and here we'll use the NumPy mean.

26
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,030
Here's the results.

27
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,806
We see there are NaN values for

28
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:39,918
vendors who didn't have an entry
in a given year like Ford in 2012.

29
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:43,937
And we see that most vendors don't have a
change in battery capacity over the years,

30
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,010
except for Tesla,
as they've introduced several new models.

31
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,250
Now, pivot tables aren't limited to one
function that you might want to apply.

32
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,905
You can pass aggfunc, a list of
the different functions to apply,

33
00:01:55,905 --> 00:02:00,110
and pandas will provide you with the
result using hierarchical column names.

34
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,822
Here, I’ll also pass margins equals true.

35
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:06,882
And that you can see for each of
the functions there's now an all category,

36
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:10,687
which shows the overall mean and
the minimum values for a given year and

37
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:11,610
a given vendor.

38
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,300
So that's pivot tables.

39
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,190
This has been a pretty short description,
but

40
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,180
they're incredibly useful when
dealing with numeric data.

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,670
And of course, you can pass any function
you want to the aggregate function,

42
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,460
including those that you define yourself.
