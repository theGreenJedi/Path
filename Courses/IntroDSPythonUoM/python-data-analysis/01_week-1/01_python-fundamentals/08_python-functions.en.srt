1
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:09,959
In the rest of this module,

2
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:13,750
I'm going to provide a very basic overview
of the Python programming language.

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,890
If you have a background in programming,

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,530
this overview should be enough to help you
be successful in the rest of this course

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,090
and the following courses
in this specialization.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,330
If you don't have
a programming experience or

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,180
feel like content is overly challenging,
then I would encourage you to stop and

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,750
take an introductory programming class.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,320
A colleague of mine, Dr. Chuck Severance
offers an excellent specialization on

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,760
Coursera, called Python for Everybody.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,780
You can find a link to that
in the course resources.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,240
The Coursera system allows you to run
Python code from your browser in two ways.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,390
First, we can use in-video prompts,
where a question will come up and

14
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,030
you can try and
solve that question in the browser.

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,070
This is new to the Coursera platform and

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,840
we're going to try it in
the next couple of lectures.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,080
Second, the Coursera system has been
integrated with Jupyter notebooks.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,370
These notebooks allow you to divide your
code up into what they call cells, and

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,710
execute these cells on demand.

20
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,640
The nice thing about these notebook
is that they offer a semi-permanent

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,330
storage for your learning and
you can experiment and

22
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,230
play with programming without having
to install anything on your computer.

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,300
All of the assignments will be done in the
Jupiter notebooks but you can of course

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,390
download and install, Python, Jupyter, all
of the associated libraries you need for

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,300
this course on your own
computer if you'd like.

26
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,260
Our tutorial assistant will
provide an overview of this

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,170
process by installing the Jupyter
notebooks locally in the next video for

28
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,890
those of you who are interested, and I'll
give an overview of how you can use these

29
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,360
notebooks in the Coursera
environment in this lecture.

30
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,470
But for now,
let's dig in to some basic Python.

31
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,040
First, Python is a high level language,
which means it's optimized for

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,830
reading by people instead of machines.

33
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,210
It's also an interpreted language which
means it isn't compiled directly to

34
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,680
machine code and importantly is commonly
used in an interactive fashion.

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,750
This might be quite different if you're
used to programming in something like

36
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,930
Java or C, where you write your code,
compile it, run it, and watch the output.

37
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,680
In Python, you can start the interactive
interpreter and begin writing code,

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,240
line by line, with the interpreter
evaluating each statement as you write it.

39
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,090
This turns out to be very useful for

40
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,100
tasks that require a lot of investigation,
versus those that require a lot of design.

41
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,320
Shell scripting is one example of this.

42
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,415
And data cleaning is another.

43
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:27,750
Or you can write scripts that
execute programs like you might be

44
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,310
used to another languages.

45
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,030
We're going to use Python
throw specialization

46
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,429
in this interactive fashion.

47
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,260
A common surprise for some programmers
coming from a Java or C background is that

48
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,100
Python is a dynamically typed language,
similar to languages like JavaScript.

49
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,120
This means that when
you declare a variable,

50
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,390
you can assign it to be an integer on
one line, and a string on the next line.

51
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,450
Since there is no compilation step,

52
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,910
you don't have anyone to
help you manage types.

53
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,700
You need to either check for the presence
of functionality when you go to use it or

54
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,530
try and use the functionality and
catch any errors that occur.

55
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,970
The dynamic typing of Python is
particularly nice when used in

56
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,200
an interactive fashion,
as it allows you to quickly set and

57
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,460
modify variable contents without having
to worry about the underlying syntactic

58
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,559
definition of the variable.

59
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,030
Okay, so let's jump in with an example.

60
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,250
For all of the coded examples I'll show
you, you'll find an annotated version of

61
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,970
the notebook with more comments
in the course resources section.

62
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,410
You're welcome to follow along with that
if you'd like or create a new notebook and

63
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,060
actively write code, if you prefer.

64
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,710
Python is very little boiler plate code.

65
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,110
In fact, if you just wanted to set the
value of a couple of variables, and output

66
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,240
the results of these variables added
together, you could do so in three lines.

67
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,570
In this example,
I'll write three statements.

68
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,380
The first two set the variables x and
y, each to be some integer value.

69
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,420
Then we'll do some addition.

70
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,710
We can run this cell by
hitting shift+enter or

71
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,000
by clicking on the play
head icon in the tool bar.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,150
The output from the statement
is immediately printed.

73
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,610
If you were using Python in a non
interactive mode, nothing would print.

74
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,960
But since we're using it in interactive
mode, we get the value immediately.

75
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,740
What's happening underneath is that
the browser is sending your Python code

76
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,550
across to a machine in the cloud,

77
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,100
which executes the code in a Python three
interpreter, and sends the results back.

78
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,880
We can see that after executing a cell,
a new empty cell is created for us below.

79
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,200
If we just put in x and
execute, we get the value of 1.

80
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,820
So it's important to know that
the Python interpreter is stateful.

81
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,560
That is,
that your variables exist between cells.

82
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,130
Beyond that, if we go back and
change something in a previous cell,

83
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,050
we have to re-execute the script
to make those changes take place.

84
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,730
The restart and run all function is
particularly useful, as it wipes

85
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,670
the interpreter state and reruns all
of the cells in the current notebook.

86
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,310
You'll notice that Python
doesn't require the use of

87
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,330
keywords like var to
declare a variable name or

88
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,680
semicolons at the end of lines which
are commonly used in other languages.

89
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,280
Python leverages white space to
understand the scope of functions and

90
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,700
loops and end of line markers to
understand the end of statements.

91
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,680
Of course, Python has traditional
software structures like functions.

92
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,750
Here's an example, refactoring that
previous code into a function.

93
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,470
You'll see the deaf statement indicates
that we're writing a function.

94
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,320
Then each line that is part of
the function needs to be indented

95
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,440
with a tab character or
a couple of spaces.

96
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,200
Again, because we're in an interactive
environment, when the statement is

97
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,330
evaluated on a shift+enter, the results
are printed out immediately below.

98
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,110
Here's our first bit of interaction.

99
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,878
Why don't you try and change this function
to accept three parameters instead of two

100
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:46,175
and return the sum of all three of those.

101
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,168
Okay, functions are great but they're
a bit different than you might find in

102
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:55,420
other languages and
here are some of subtleties involved.

103
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,810
First, since there's no typing,
you don't have to set your return time.

104
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,930
Second, you don't have to set user
return statement at all actually.

105
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,030
There's a special value
called none that's returned.

106
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,650
None a similar to null in Java and
represents the absence of value.

107
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,820
Third, in Python, you can have
default values for parameters.

108
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,980
Here's an example.

109
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,390
In this example, we can rewrite the add
numbers function to take three parameters,

110
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,970
but we could set the last
parameter to be none by default.

111
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,220
This means that you can call add numbers
with just two values or with three, and

112
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,100
you don't have to rewrite the function
signature to overload it.

113
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,650
This is an important implication.

114
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,580
All of the optional parameters,
the ones that you got default values for,

115
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,030
need to come at the end of
the function declaration.

116
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,100
It also means that you can pass
an optional parameters as labeled values.

117
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,600
Here's an example of a labeled parameters.

118
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,135
We can rewrite that function so
that there's two optional parameters.

119
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:55,300
If we want to call the function
with just two numbers but

120
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,690
also set the flag value,
we have to explicitly name and

121
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,670
set the flag parameter to true
when invoking the function.

122
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,650
By now, you've also seen
the use of the print statement.

123
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,000
We're going to dive into
strings in more detail, but

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,950
print will take an item, try and convert
it to a string and print the output.

125
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,910
We don't use this much in the interactive
mode of the interpreter, but

126
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,110
it's useful when we want to print out
multiple values for a single cell.

127
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,840
Okay, a final word on the basics
of functions in Python.

128
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,740
In Python,
you can assign a variable to a function.

129
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,910
This might seem either
completely normal to you or

130
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,410
completely odd depending upon
on your programming background.

131
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,950
By assigning a variable to a function,
you can pass that variable into

132
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,830
other functions allowing some
basic functional programming.

133
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,160
We'll talk about that a little
bit later on in the course.

134
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,620
But here's an example where we
define a function to add numbers,

135
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,290
then we assign that function to a
variable, and then we invoke the variable.
