00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:12,328
You may have seen the keyword lambda
appear in this week's content, and

2
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:16,196
you'll certainly see it appear more as you
spend more and more time with Python and

3
00:00:16,196 --> 00:00:17,880
data science.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,770
Lambda's are Python's way of
creating anonymous functions.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,630
These are the same as other functions,
but they have no name.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,060
The intent is that they're simple or

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,440
short lived and it's easier just to
write out the function in one line

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,169
instead of going to the trouble
of creating a named function.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,460
The lambda syntax is fairly simple.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,590
But it might take a bit
of time to get used to.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,270
You declare a lambda function with
the word lambda followed by a list of

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,610
arguments, followed by a colon and
then a single expression and this is key.

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,596
There's only one expression
to be evaluated in a lambda.

14
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:54,299
The expression value is returned
on execution of the lambda.

15
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,520
The return of a lambda
is a function reference.

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,550
So in this case,
you would execute my_function and

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,290
pass in three different parameters.

18
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,530
Note that you can't have default
values for lambda parameters and

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,870
you can't have complex logic
inside of the lambda itself

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,950
because you're limited
to a single expression.

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,420
So lambdas are really much more limited
than full function definitions.

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,360
But I think they're very useful for
simple little data cleaning tasks.

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,040
And you'll see lots of
examples with them on the web.

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,530
So you should be able to read and
write lambdas.

25
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,510
Let's give it a try here.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,530
We've learned a lot about sequences and
in Python.

27
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,470
Tuples, lists, dictionaries and so forth.

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,580
Sequences are structures that
we can iterate over, and

29
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,590
often we create these through loops or
by reading in data from a file.

30
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,720
Python has built in support for creating
these collections using a more abbreviated

31
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,140
syntax called list comprehensions.

32
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,690
Here's an example.

33
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,380
First we write up a little for-loop.

34
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,740
Here I'm iterating between zero and
1,000 and then checking with the modulus

35
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,230
operator to see if the number divided
by two results in any decimals.

36
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,880
If the modulus two of the number is zero,
then I know it divides evenly so

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,530
this must be an even number and
I'll add it to our list.

38
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,360
We can rewrite this as
a list comprehension by

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,980
pulling the iteration on one line.

40
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,300
We start the list comprehension
with the value we want in the list.

41
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,770
In this case, it's a number.

42
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,030
Then we put it in the for-loop, and then
finally, we add any condition clauses.

43
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,920
You can see that this is much
more compact of a format.

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,690
And it tends to be faster as well.

45
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,890
Just like with lambdas,
list comprehensions are a condensed format

46
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,030
which may offer readability and
performance benefits and

47
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,190
you'll often find them being used in data
science tutorials or on stack overflow.

48
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,170
But you're not required to use them
in the assignments in this course.

49
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,702
Here, why don't you try converting
a function into a list comprehension.
