1
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:12,500
A lot of analysis you do might
relate to dates and times.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,630
For instance, finding the average
number of sales over a given period,

3
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,815
selecting a list of products to data mine
if they were purchased in a given period,

4
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:24,395
or trying to find the period with
the most activity in online discussion

5
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:26,130
forum systems.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,670
In this course, we're not going to delve
too deeply into time series analysis, but

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,960
I wanted to show you some
of the basics in Python.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,020
First, you should be aware that date and

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,710
times can be stored in
many different ways.

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,670
One of the most common legacy methods for
storing the date and

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,390
time in online transactions systems is
based on the offset from the epoch,

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,610
which is January 1, 1970.

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,650
There's a lot of historical cruft around
this, but it's not uncommon to see systems

14
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:59,060
storing the date of a transaction in
seconds or milliseconds since this date.

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,270
So if you see large numbers where
you expect to see date and time,

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,920
you'll need to convert them to
make much sense out of the data.

17
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,570
In Python, you can get the current time
since the epoch using the time module.

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,310
You can then create a time stamp
using the from time stamp function

19
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,460
on the date time object.

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,210
When we print this value out,
we see that the year, month, day, and so

21
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,630
forth are also printed out.

22
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,960
The date time object has handy attributes
to get the representative hour, day,

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,260
seconds, etc.

24
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:34,930
Date time objects allow for
simple math using time deltas.

25
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,780
For instance, here,
we can create a time delta of 100 days,

26
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,790
then do subtraction and comparisons
with the date time object.

27
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,040
This is commonly used in data science for
creating sliding windows.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,140
For instance,
where you might want to look for

29
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,880
any five day span of time where sales were
highest, and flag that for follow up.

30
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,830
This is just a little glimpse at dates and
times in Python.

31
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,100
In week three of this course,
we're going to investigate dates and

32
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,170
times a bit more using
the pandas date time library.
